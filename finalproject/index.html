	<p>
		Chris Reid's musical background started in fifth grade with the video game, Guitar Hero. That game absorbed all of his time 
		because it was so challenging and fun. His dad, Darwin, recommended that he should put his talents to better use. He eventually 
		enrolled in guitar lessons and started getting good enough to start a band. 
		He started a band with a few friends from school and they never looked back. His band's music wasn’t that good, but they believed in themselves. 
		They performed live gigs and started to improve little by little.

		Eventually, Chris wanted to record some of his music professionally. He decided to go to college at Northwestern Michigan College
		to study Audio Technology. There he learned all it takes to make professional recordings. Now, He is trying to learn the business side of
		things to hopefully pursue a career in music. It has been an exciting journey and he can’t wait to keep learning more.
